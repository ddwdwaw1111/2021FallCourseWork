ðŸ˜ƒ: This is Zihao Wang, computer science major, class of 2022. I have taken all the required courses for computer science major. 
In addition, I took Software Engineering a year ago and Introduction to Data Science last semester. 
During Software Engineering, we build a little game demo include picking up staff, using poisons, killing mobs and defeat the boss. 
We built that game by using unity, and my part is all the actions, animations of mobs and the final boss battle. 
During Intro to data science, I was trying to build a map reduce base convolutional neural network that can distinguish handwritten digits.
I didnâ€™t build that out at the end of the semester, but I did learn a lot about deep learning and the concept of map-reduce.
I was doing an intern this summer, I learned HTML+CSS+PHP and learned a little bit of react.
In this web programming course, I wish I could learn more about web development. 

ðŸ¥¢  In my opinion, this course may lead me to full stack web developer. 
While practicing the coding skill, I think the process of building two web application is a great experience that I can write in my resume. 
Also, I am excited about the debugging process during the course. 
After this course, I want to be an expert in debugging which I think is one of the most important skills that a programmer need.
